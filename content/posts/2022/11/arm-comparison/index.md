<p>Hi everyone - like many of you, I love the x86 vs arm race that is going on and actually use an M1 Max as my daily driver - with a 5950x + 3080 with 32GB of b-die as my backup/gaming machine - and so I'm always on the lookout for faster and more capable arm boards, or even full servers.</p>

Sadly, most arm servers are still *much* too expensive to use in my homelab, although the [Honeycomb LXS Server](https://www.servethehome.com/solidrun-honeycomb-lx2-server-announced-1u-2-node-arm/) is getting closer to reasonable prices ($3k for the server, $800 for just the board + cpu).

A friend of mine left Apple's processor division and went to work for Qualcomm and is holding out hope that the [Qualcomm Cloud AI 100](https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/Prod-Brief-QCOM-Cloud-AI-100.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0pYyGkqA1sx7ukYb9Ctfq6yS7BJMSbQJlG5Ad0nPqry5_sf0l4mGfn3OE) will provide some competition in the server space and also believes that their desktop efforts will bear fruit. Their desktop effort are based on a company they acquired [Nuvia](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/337029-qualcomm-promises-its-new-cpus-will-aim-for-desktop-performance-leadership-but-may-not-ship-until-2024) and not 'yet another' re-purposed mobile chip. They claim we'll see silicon shipping in 2024, but we'll see.

I wrote all this today because I was interested to see how my 6-core ODroid-N2+ SBC (widely regarded as the faster ARM SBCs out) fared in Geekbench against my 10-core M1 Max - I know, not fair at all, but still interesting.

<small>(And yes, I know Geekbench is seethingly hated amongst professional reviewers, but it works for our purposes just fine ...)</small>

So, without further adoo:
