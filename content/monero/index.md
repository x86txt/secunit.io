"The majority of existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, but not Monero, have transparent blockchains - i.e. transactions can be verified and/or traced by anyone in the world. This means that the sending and receiving addresses of these transactions could potentially be linked to real-world identities."
