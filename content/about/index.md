## Matthew Evans 
### I am a 25+ year industry veteran with a knack for architecting creative, scalable, and secure on-prem or cloud solutions.  


I was responsible for launching and securing a [$200 billion AUM hybrid-cloud SaaS platform](https://www.alphatheory.com/) & a [$500 million AUM hedge fund](https://centerbook.com/). Most recently I managed the AWS cloud infrastructure and security posture for [Prometheus Alternative Investments](https://prometheusalts.com/). I managed the global HQ infrastructure and security team for [HondaJet](https://www.hondajet.com/) through [first-flight](https://global.honda/newsroom/worldnews/2010/c101221FAA-Conforming-HondaJet.html) (I'm at 3:48 in the video), and I volunteer my free time on privacy projects such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/). There are a couple kids, a dog, and a pretty amazing wife I have no idea how I landed in there too.

In my spare time, I spend way to much time on Reddit and a fair chunk reading military SciFi too. Check out my GoodReads profile at the bottom of the page and shoot me any genre suggestions you might have. As you can probably tell, I'm a pretty big fan of [Martha Wells'](https://marthawells.dreamwidth.org/) [The Murderbot Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries). If you haven't read them, you are in for a treat. She's been signed to write 3 more full length novels by Tor, with the first ['System Collapse'](https://www.marthawells.com/murderbot7.htm) dropping on November 14, 2023 - so get to it. You won't be disappointed.
